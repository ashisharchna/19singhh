<h1> My Top 3 Hobbies </h1>
<li> Gym </li>
<li> Working </li>
<li> Family </li>
<p> I like to workout in the gym because i find it fun and relaxing. I take my cousin with me so we get to catch up too. I go about 3 times a week i used to go more but i dont have a lot of time now. The gym i go to is retro fitness. When i go to the gym i feel like i clear my mind. When im leaving yes im hurting but my mind is clear. I take my emotions and problems to the gym. If i do not go to the gym for a while i start feeling weird.
</p>
<p> My second hobbie is working. The only reason i like working is because i like to see the money come into my bank. I lik ethe job as well. I work at sears and i do the tools department and we just have to sells tools and build grills. It is a easy job but sometimes it just gets really busy and stressful. The money is good thats what i like.
</p>
<p> My last hobbie is spending time with my family. I like to spend tuime because when we all get together i have so much fun just talking to them and just being around them really makes me happy. I like my older cousins because they are funny and we just get along. When we go out we make fun of each other and that funny. When we are together we all act different but when we are around the rest of our family we are different.
